              <p>
                David has spent his entire career serving the community.
              </p>

              <p>
                After graduating from Shorecrest High School, David developed a
                passion for social justice and leadership by serving as a
                community facilitator in Western Washington University’s campus
                ministry. David then attended Seattle University School of Law
                where he worked with youth at the King County Juvenile Detention
                Center and educated them on how to advocate for their rights.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a young attorney, David fought for civil rights representing
                employees in discrimination and civil rights claims. Currently,
                he is the General Counsel of CRISTA Ministries, an organization
                serving Shoreline’s seniors and youths through housing and
                education. CRISTA also provides assistance globally through
                international development and disaster relief.
              </p>

              <p>
                David is a former member of the Parks Funding Advisory Committee
                and several non-profit boards, including seven years with Vision
                House in Shoreline, an agency that successfully moved hundreds
                of single parents and their children from homelessness to
                permanent housing.
              </p>
              <p>
                David and his wife Chelsey are the proud parents of three
                children. They live in the Echo Lake neighborhood with their
                dog. David and Chelsey are active volunteers with the Echo Lake
                Neighborhood Association, Shoreline Little League, Cascade K-8
                PTSA, St. Catherine of Siena Church, and the Midvale Community
                Garden.

                  Affordable Housing for all Ages and Incomes
                </h3>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  Shoreline needs more affordable and diverse housing options.
                  Our community needs housing for seniors looking to age in
                  place and for families looking for a place to call home. David
                  will increase access to both rental and permanent housing for
                  all ages and incomes. David supports strategic development to
                  bring small businesses and living wage jobs to Shoreline by
                  modernizing building codes and creating incentives that
                  support sustainable growth.

                <p class="mb-0">
                  As a father of three, David knows the importance of safe,
                  walkable streets. Shoreline needs properly maintained
                  sidewalks; improved lighting on streets and walking paths;
                  more accessible community gathering spaces; and safe trails
                  connecting people to parks, nature, and businesses. As a
                  member of the City Council, David will collaborate with
                  residents to prioritize specific locations that need immediate
                  improvement and will develop a long-term plan to create a
                  welcoming, inclusive city center.

                  As the former Board President of Vision House—a non-profit
                  housing agency in Shoreline that helps single parents and
                  their children transition out of homelessness into permanent
                  housing—David has hands-on experience and expertise addressing
                  homelessness. In addition to supporting local direct-service
                  organizations and increasing affordable housing options, David
                  will work across boundaries to implement a regional strategy
                  that tackles barriers to permanent housing. David supports
                  on-demand addiction and mental health services that will help
                  our neighbors get off the streets and into stable housing.

                  David will support increased diversity and resiliency of small
                  businesses in Shoreline by reducing the barriers to starting
                  and operating a business in the city. Shoreline needs to
                  encourage business development and partnerships by increasing
                  pedestrian traffic, available parking and neighborhood
                  gathering spaces, within our commercial centers.
