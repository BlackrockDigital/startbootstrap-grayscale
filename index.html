          <p>I take pride in having spent my entire career serving the community. A graduate of Shorecrest High School and Western
            Washington University, I gained a passion for social justice and leadership by serving as a community facilitator in
            campus ministry.</p>
          
          <p>I returned to the Seattle University School of Law, working with youth to advocate for their rights at the juvenile
            detention center. As a young attorney, I represented employees in discriminations claims and protected individuals’
            civil rights. I now have the pleasure of serving as General Counsel of CRISTA Ministries, an organization that serves
            Shoreline’s seniors and students in housing and education, and globally through internal development and disaster
            relief.</p>
          
          <p>I served on the Parks Funding Advisory Committee and several not-for-profit boards, including 7 years with Vision
            House in Shoreline, an agency that successfully moves hundreds of single parents and their children from homelessness
            to permanent housing.</p>
          
          <p>I am the proud parent of three children, Alyssa, Zachary and Isaiah, who also attend Shoreline Public Schools. My
            wife and I live in the Echo Lake Neighborhood and serve as active volunteers with the Echo Lake Neighborhood
            Association, Cascade K-8 PTA, and Midvale Community Garden.</p>
