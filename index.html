I began to count how many I had.</p>

I enjoyed it because they have pets, and chickens. The house seemed big. But recently I went there. It was very hard to recognize the house. The houses were demolished by the regime. After I recognized the house, the remains of the house seemed much smaller than the house that I remembered. The streets also seem to be smaller than that I had in mind when I was 5..</p>

I remember when we went to Gali Ali Beg, Hamilton Road. There we parked for a while. I went down to the river with you. It was a sunny day. I played with water by the side of the river. The water was a bit cold, but I enjoyed playing with the water, there were also big rocks. Later some other people had parked and their kids came down. We all played together for a while till we started going home.</p>

You said we can’t drive home at night, we don’t have much petrol and there is no petrol station nearby. We stayed with the family. They were friendly. They had kids. We played and laughed very much. In the morning we left after you had gotten some petrol. </p>
